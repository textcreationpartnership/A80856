            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

The King may give the Jewels of his Crown by Letters Patents, but cannot by testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dispose them. <hi>Berkley,</hi> this permission of the husbands for her to wear them, is as a gift to her, 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 83. that by the custom of <hi>London</hi> in elsewhere, the wife shall have the moyety of the goods, Her husband might in this case give them in his life time, but by his will he cannot dispose them to her preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. Whereupon they concluded for the Defendant. But <hi>Richardson</hi> and <hi>Crook</hi> held, that the wife cannot take these, but according to the husbands disposition by Will. But had the husband made no Will, but left them to the disposition of the Law, there (had the contest been betwixt the wife and Executor, or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrator) she might have them as a <hi>Paraphernalia.</hi> And it is not like the case of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 83. And now the husband can give nothing to the wife, they being but one person in Law. And as to the objection, that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170315:100"/> though the Husband may dispose them by act in his life, yet not by will. Answered, That a man who hath a thing real in anothers right, or a Chattel personal, though give, yet he cannot devise it. So an Executor may give, but not devise, because he hath it <hi>in auter droit,</hi> But of all Chattels personal, which the wife, though had them before marriage, the absolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty by the marriage is vested in the husband, and he may devise them.

A Feme for her <hi>Quarentine</hi> may have her living <hi>de Communi;</hi> but she may not take any thing, unless for necessity. And the Common Law is against, that the wife may make her will, and dispose these <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phernalia invito marito.</hi> But of Bonds, or things in action, by the husbands assent, she may make her Executors. 4 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 31. 31. 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 27. 26 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 71.

                     <p n="1">1. The first question was, Whether the lease to <hi>A.S.</hi> determined after death of Tenant <hi>per</hi> courtesie, or onely determinable by the heirs entry.
